            <h2 class="featurette-heading"> The story of Brooklyn Museum and Metropolitan Museum of Art
            </h2>

            <p class="lead"> Metropolitan Museum and Brooklyn Museum are both funded by Cultural Institutions Group (CIG) in late 19th Century. These two museums are New York City's the largest and the second largest in physical size.
            In Met, there are more than two million works. In addition, there are 1.5 million works in Brooklyn Museum. Although these two museums have much in common, the number of visitors between them is dramatically different, after 100 years. 
<br><br>
            In 2009, there are only 326,000 visitors of Brooklyn Museum but 4,891,450 visitors of Met. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/arts/design/15museum.html?pagewanted=all&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C%7B%222%22%3A%22RI%3A17%22%7D&_r=1&">[link]</a> 
<br><br>
            I believe the visitor number somehow represent the power of the museum. I would love to tell the readers a story about what led this two art museums to different level.

               <br>
                <h4>My Goal : </h4>
                <p>1. Studying the number of visitors changing in the past 20 years.
                <br>
                2. Trying to find the average funding amount from the CIG and other groups or  individual in the past 20 years.  
                <br>
                3. Doing a demographic research around upper east side and prospect park/ park slope area. Finding out the median household income gap. </p><br>

            <p class="lead">

             Nicolas Cage, the world famous actor. He is one of the most productive actors in the world. Best known as a Leading Actor based on credits in that role in 55 films <a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/person/520401-Nicolas-Cage#tab=acting">[Link]</a> (
             Anthony Hopkins, 57 films;  Samuel L. Jackson, 50 movies)<br><br>

            He won oscar once in 1996 as the Best Actor in a Leading Role of the movie Leaving Las Vegas. He also have so many incredible performance in other movies. Such as Wild at heart, Adaptation, Raising Arizona ..etc. But meanwhile, he is one of the most horrible actor in the world. Many of his movie got extremely low rating from critics. The fantastic Mr. Cage, the worst Mr. Cage. What an interesting combination!<br><br>

            Since I'm a super huge fan of Nic cage, I would love to make an infographic based on his career life, box office, movie ratings, and the number of Cage internet meme.

                <h4>My Goal : </h4>
                <p>1. Using the data I collected from IMDB, Rotton Tomato and the number. Sorting them, merging them in Excel to find out any interesting result.
                <br>
                2. Searching the Nic Cage meme, displaying them by time. Matching the meme with my cage data, creating an interesting interactive data project. </p><br>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading"> U.S. customer returns and fraud rate in retail store
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">

                As a girl lives in NYC, I shopping a lot and I retuen stuffs. I never think it's a wrong thing to do but I also curious how the system works. Also, the relationship between the sale and returns.<br><br>

                So I found a report from the National Retail Federation. <a herf="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCgQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theretailequation.com%2FRetailers%2Fimages%2Fpublic%2Fpdfs%2Findustry_reports%2FTRE3013_NRF_Retail_Returns_Survey_Canada_2013.pdf&ei=PQ5YVLu8D6-BsQTSr4JA&usg=AFQjCNGjwna-s35-mrDPe_pGHuzI3ePhXA&bvm=bv.78677474,d.cWc
                "> [Link] </a> 

                It's interesting to see which state got the highest return rate and compare it to the nationwide retail sale, how much impact it would make to the retail industry. Also, the percentage of fraudulent returns over the country. Might be interesting if I can add another piece of data, such as unemployment and see if they correlate. If they don't, that would be interesting. 

                <h4>My Goal : </h4>
                <p>1. Createing an interactive map 
                <br>
                2. Finding out the OTHER data, playing with the fraudulent returns </p><br>
